Welcome to SHED's documentation!
================================

Streaming Heterogeneous Event Data (SHED) is a system for streaming
data from the event model into a Streamz graph while tracking data
provenance and workflow execution.

Installation
============

``shed`` is installable via the ``conda`` package manager.
If you don't have Anaconda (or miniconda) installed please follow the instructions
from `Data Carpentry <https://datacarpentry.org/2016-05-29-PyCon/install.html>`_.

With Anaconda or miniconda please enter into a terminal (on Windows Anaconda
ships with a dedicated command prompt) and type

``conda install shed -c conda-forge``

and follow the prompts. This will install the shed software and all of its dependencies.
