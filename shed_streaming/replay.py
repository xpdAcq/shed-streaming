# One problem we're facing is that the various pipelines handle document
# filling external to the logic of the data processing (outside of the captured
# graph. This is a good thing since assuming that the documents have the data
# we're looking for is nice. However, we need to do this on the replay as well
# since our pipeline expects the data to be loaded. This could be done in the
# creation of the data dict but that requires us loading up all the data at
# once which is a major anti-pattern. We could use a filler but then we
# run into issues since we don't actually track the resource and datum
# documents in the FromEventModel nodes since they didn't exist until recently
# (and they aren't really used in the data processing).
